# Data Structures
This is a collection of the most common and used data structures implemented in `Python 3.6` using a TDD/BDD style (Behave) 

### Data Structures to Implement:
- ~~Set~~
- ~~Hash Map (or Hash Table)~~
- ~~Linked List~~
- ~~Stack~~
- ~~Queues~~
- ~~BST~~
- ~~Tries~~
- ~~Heaps~~


### Next steps:
- use better assertion lib ([PyHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/PyHamcrest) ?)
- extend type hinting to every class
